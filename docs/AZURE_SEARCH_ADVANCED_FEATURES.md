# Advanced Azure Cognitive Search Features for Code Search

This document explains how to leverage advanced Azure Cognitive Search features to create a superior code search experience.

## Current vs Enhanced Implementation

### Current Implementation
- Basic text search with vector embeddings
- Simple filtering by language/repository
- Semantic search with default configuration
- Standard relevance scoring

### Enhanced Implementation
- Custom analyzers for code-specific tokenization
- Scoring profiles for relevance tuning
- Autocomplete and suggestions
- Faceted navigation
- Hit highlighting
- Fuzzy search for typo tolerance
- AI enrichment for code insights

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Custom Analyzers for Code

**Problem**: Default analyzers don't understand code syntax (camelCase, snake_case, import paths)

**Solution**: Custom analyzers that properly tokenize code:

```python
# CamelCase Analyzer
- Splits: "getUserName" → ["get", "user", "name"]
- Handles: Java, C#, JavaScript naming conventions

# Snake_case Analyzer  
- Splits: "get_user_name" → ["get", "user", "name"]
- Handles: Python, Ruby naming conventions

# Import Path Analyzer
- Splits: "com.example.auth" → ["com", "example", "auth"]
- Handles: Package imports and module paths
```

### 2. Scoring Profiles

**Problem**: All results have equal relevance weight

**Solution**: Three scoring profiles that boost results based on:

#### Code Freshness Profile
- Boosts recently modified code (last 30 days)
- Prioritizes actively maintained functions
- Useful for finding current implementations

#### Code Quality Profile
- Boosts well-tested code (high test coverage)
- Prioritizes frequently referenced functions
- Emphasizes documented code (docstrings)

#### Tag Boost Profile
- Boosts code with specific tags (e.g., "security", "performance")
- Customizable per search query
- Helps find specialized implementations

### 3. Autocomplete & Suggestions

**Problem**: Users must type exact function names

**Solution**: Two suggesters for real-time completions:

```python
# Function Suggester
Input: "auth"
Suggestions: ["authenticate", "authorize", "auth_middleware", "AuthManager"]

# Import Suggester
Input: "numpy"
Suggestions: ["numpy.array", "numpy.linalg", "numpy.random"]
```

### 4. Faceted Search

**Problem**: No way to filter/analyze large result sets

**Solution**: Facets provide result breakdown:

```json
{
  "facets": {
    "language": [
      {"value": "python", "count": 45},
      {"value": "javascript", "count": 23}
    ],
    "repository": [
      {"value": "main-app", "count": 38},
      {"value": "auth-service", "count": 30}
    ],
    "tags": [
      {"value": "security", "count": 15},
      {"value": "api", "count": 12}
    ]
  }
}
```

### 5. Hit Highlighting

**Problem**: Hard to see why results matched

**Solution**: Highlights matching terms in context:

```python
# Query: "user authentication"
# Result: "def <mark>authenticate_user</mark>(username, password):"
```

### 6. Fuzzy Search

**Problem**: Typos return no results

**Solution**: Automatic typo tolerance:

```python
# Query: "athenticate" (typo)
# Still finds: "authenticate", "authentication"
```

### 7. Synonym Support

**Problem**: Different terms for same concept

**Solution**: Synonym maps for common programming terms:

```
auth → authentication, authorize, authorization
db → database, storage
func → function, method, procedure
```

### 8. AI Enrichment

**Problem**: No semantic understanding of code

**Solution**: Cognitive skills for code analysis:

- **Key Phrase Extraction**: Identifies important concepts in docstrings
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects TODOs, FIXMEs, deprecation warnings
- **Custom Skills**: Code complexity analysis, security pattern detection

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create Enhanced Index

```python
from azure_search_enhanced import EnhancedAzureSearch

search = EnhancedAzureSearch(endpoint, api_key)
search.create_enhanced_index()
```

### Step 2: Index with Metadata

```python
document = {
    "id": "func_123",
    "code_content": "def authenticate_user(username, password):",
    "function_name": "authenticate_user",
    "language": "python",
    "repository": "auth-service",
    "last_modified": datetime.now(),
    "complexity_score": 3.5,
    "test_coverage": 0.85,
    "tags": ["security", "authentication"],
    "imports": ["hashlib", "jwt", "bcrypt"]
}
```

### Step 3: Search with Advanced Features

```python
results = search.search_with_advanced_features(
    query="user authentication",
    filters="language eq 'python'",
    scoring_profile="code_quality",
    boost_tags=["security"],
    fuzzy_search=True,
    semantic_search=True
)
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Index Aliases
- Enable zero-downtime index updates
- A/B test different configurations
- Rollback capability

### 2. Query Performance
- Use filters before search for better performance
- Limit facet counts for large datasets
- Cache frequently used queries

### 3. Monitoring
- Track query patterns with Application Insights
- Monitor search latency
- Analyze failed queries for improvements

## Cost Optimization

### 1. Tiered Approach
- Hot tier: Recent/popular code with all features
- Warm tier: Older code with basic search
- Cold tier: Archived code with minimal indexing

### 2. Selective Features
- Enable vector search only for semantic queries
- Use AI enrichment selectively
- Compress large text fields

### 3. Index Management
- Regular cleanup of unused documents
- Optimize replica count based on load
- Use Basic tier for development/testing

## Integration with MCP

### Enhanced MCP Tool

```python
@server.tool()
async def search_code_advanced(
    query: str,
    use_ai: bool = True,
    include_metrics: bool = True,
    boost_quality: bool = True
):
    """Advanced code search with all Azure Search features"""
    
    # Determine best scoring profile
    profile = "code_quality" if boost_quality else "code_freshness"
    
    # Search with advanced features
    results = await enhanced_search.search_with_advanced_features(
        query=query,
        scoring_profile=profile,
        semantic_search=use_ai,
        include_highlights=True,
        fuzzy_search=True
    )
    
    # Include code metrics if requested
    if include_metrics:
        for result in results["results"]:
            result["metrics"] = {
                "complexity": result.get("complexity_score"),
                "coverage": result.get("test_coverage"),
                "references": result.get("reference_count")
            }
    
    return results
```

## Best Practices

1. **Indexing Strategy**
   - Index at function/class level for precision
   - Include surrounding context for understanding
   - Update incrementally on code changes

2. **Search Strategy**
   - Start with semantic search for natural queries
   - Fall back to keyword search for specific terms
   - Use filters to narrow scope before searching

3. **Relevance Tuning**
   - Monitor click-through rates
   - Adjust scoring profiles based on user behavior
   - A/B test different configurations

4. **User Experience**
   - Show facets for easy filtering
   - Highlight matches in results
   - Provide autocomplete for common searches

## Conclusion

By leveraging these advanced Azure Cognitive Search features, the code search experience becomes:
- More accurate (custom analyzers, scoring profiles)
- More forgiving (fuzzy search, synonyms)
- More intelligent (AI enrichment, semantic search)
- More interactive (facets, autocomplete, highlighting)

This creates a superior developer experience that helps find the right code faster and with better context.
