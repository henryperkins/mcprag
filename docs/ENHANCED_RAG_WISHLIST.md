# Enhanced RAG for Claude Code - Feature Wishlist

> **Vision**: Create the most sophisticated code-aware RAG system specifically optimized for Claude Code's workflow, providing context-intelligent retrieval that understands not just what you're searching for, but exactly why you need it based on your current coding context.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

Transform from **"search and hope"** to **"understand and deliver"** - where the RAG system acts as an intelligent coding partner that anticipates your needs based on your current context, recent work, and coding patterns.
