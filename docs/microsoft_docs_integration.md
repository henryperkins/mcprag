# Microsoft Docs MCP Integration

## Summary

I've successfully implemented Microsoft Docs MCP integration into your codebase. This allows you to search Microsoft Learn documentation directly through your MCP server.

## What Was Added

### 1. **Microsoft Docs MCP Client** (`microsoft_docs_mcp_client.py`)
- Handles communication with Microsoft's MCP server at `https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp`
- Supports Server-Sent Events (SSE) format that Microsoft's server uses
- Provides both basic search and context-aware search capabilities

### 2. **Enhanced MCP Server** (`mcp_server_sota.py`)
- Added `search_microsoft_docs` tool alongside existing `search_code` tool
- Integrated the Microsoft Docs client into the MCP server
- Properly formats Microsoft Docs results for MCP responses

### 3. **Configuration Updates** (`mcp-servers.json`)
- Added Microsoft Docs MCP server configuration
- Both servers (your code search and Microsoft Docs) are now available

### 4. **Test Suite** (`test_microsoft_docs_search.py`)
- Tests direct client functionality
- Tests MCP server integration
- Verifies both tools are available and working

### 5. **Dependencies** (`requirements.txt`)
- Added `aiohttp==3.9.1` for async HTTP requests

## How to Use

### Via MCP Protocol (Recommended)

When using Claude Code or another MCP client, you now have two tools available:

1. **search_code** - Search your indexed codebase
2. **search_microsoft_docs** - Search Microsoft documentation

### Direct Python Usage

```python
from microsoft_docs_mcp_client import MicrosoftDocsMCPClient

async with MicrosoftDocsMCPClient() as client:
    results = await client.search_docs("Azure Cognitive Search")
```

## Current Status

✅ Implementation complete
✅ Both search tools available in MCP server
✅ Handles Microsoft's SSE response format
✅ Test suite created
⚠️ Microsoft's server may have intermittent issues (as seen in tests)

## Next Steps

The integration is ready to use. When Microsoft's MCP server is fully operational, you'll be able to search their documentation seamlessly alongside your codebase searches.
