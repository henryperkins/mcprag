# MCP Expert Agent Improvements

## Summary of Enhancements

The mcp-expert agent has been significantly improved to be a specialized operations expert for the mcprag codebase, transforming it from a generic MCP protocol expert to a codebase-specific operational specialist.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Codebase-Specific Knowledge**
- Added deep understanding of mcprag architecture (server.py, pipeline.py, tool categories)
- Embedded knowledge of the 8-factor ranking system and multi-stage retrieval
- Included specific file paths and component dependencies
- Added awareness of protected paths and deduplication sources

### 2. **Enhanced Tool Coverage**
- Expanded from 25 tools to 50+ tools, including all mcprag-specific tools
- Added missing tools: explain_ranking, preview_query_processing, all admin tools
- Included memory-bank duplicate namespace tools
- Added brave-search tools for web search capabilities

### 3. **Proactive Trigger Description**
- Changed from passive "When to select" to active "PROACTIVE... Use IMMEDIATELY"
- Added specific trigger keywords: MCP, tool, search, index, Azure
- Emphasized operational expertise for the specific codebase

### 4. **Operational Procedures**
- Added step-by-step procedures for common tasks:
  - Initial assessment with health checks
  - Search optimization with detail_level control
  - Index management with proper confirmation
  - Performance monitoring and optimization
  - Error recovery patterns

### 5. **Automation Patterns**
- Repository indexing commands for local and GitHub repos
- Continuous monitoring loops with health checks
- Search quality improvement through feedback collection
- Batch operation examples for efficiency

### 6. **Best Practices**
- Component verification before tool use
- Token usage management with detail_level
- Batch operations for documents
- Performance monitoring via metrics
- Graceful error handling strategies

## Automation Opportunities

### 1. **Automated Health Monitoring**
```python
# Add to agent initialization
async def startup_health_check():
    health = await mcp__mcprag__health_check()
    missing = [k for k, v in health.items() if not v]
    if missing:
        print(f"Warning: Missing components: {missing}")
        print("Consider enabling in environment variables")
```

### 2. **Smart Search Optimization**
```python
# Automatically adjust detail_level based on query type
def optimize_search_params(query):
    if "overview" in query.lower():
        return {"detail_level": "ultra", "snippet_lines": 1}
    elif "debug" in query.lower():
        return {"detail_level": "full", "include_dependencies": True}
    else:
        return {"detail_level": "compact", "snippet_lines": 3}
```

### 3. **Automatic Feedback Collection**
```python
# Track all searches and prompt for feedback
async def search_with_feedback(query, **kwargs):
    query_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    results = await mcp__mcprag__search_code(query, **kwargs)
    
    # Show results to user
    display_results(results)
    
    # Prompt for feedback
    if user_found_result:
        await mcp__mcprag__track_search_click(
            query_id, selected_doc_id, selected_rank
        )
```

### 4. **Index Status Dashboard**
```python
# Regular status reporting
async def index_status_report():
    status = await mcp__mcprag__index_status()
    cache = await mcp__mcprag__cache_stats()
    
    return {
        "index": status,
        "cache_performance": cache["hit_rate"],
        "recommendations": generate_recommendations(status, cache)
    }
```

### 5. **Error Recovery Automation**
```python
# Automatic retry with component fallback
async def resilient_tool_call(tool_name, **params):
    try:
        return await globals()[f"mcp__mcprag__{tool_name}"](**params)
    except ComponentNotAvailable:
        # Try alternative approach
        if tool_name == "search_code":
            return await mcp__mcprag__search_code_raw(**params)
    except AdminModeRequired:
        print("Enable MCP_ADMIN_MODE=true in environment")
        raise
```

## Usage Recommendations

### For Users
1. **Invoke proactively** - The agent will now activate on any MCP-related mention
2. **Leverage automation** - Use the built-in patterns for common tasks
3. **Monitor performance** - Regular health checks and cache stats
4. **Provide feedback** - Help improve the adaptive ranking system

### For Developers
1. **Extend procedures** - Add more operational procedures as patterns emerge
2. **Update tool list** - Keep the tool list synchronized with server.py
3. **Document failures** - Add common error patterns and solutions
4. **Share patterns** - Add successful automation patterns to the agent

## Next Steps

1. **Create complementary agents**:
   - `azure-expert`: Specialized in Azure Search index management
   - `ranking-optimizer`: Focus on improving search quality
   - `performance-monitor`: Continuous monitoring and alerting

2. **Add hooks for automation**:
   - Pre-search query enhancement
   - Post-search feedback collection
   - Automatic index rebuild on schema changes

3. **Integrate with CI/CD**:
   - Automatic indexing on code pushes
   - Search quality regression testing
   - Performance benchmarking

The enhanced mcp-expert agent is now a true operational specialist for the mcprag codebase, providing proactive assistance with deep knowledge of the system's architecture and capabilities.
